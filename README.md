# Driver-Safety-Alert-System
A Driver Alert System is a safety system designed to monitor a driver's behavior and warn or alert them when they become drowsy for a period of time  long enough to lose situational awareness of the forward driving scene. 

# Working of Model
## Links
YOLOv5 model
Ultralytics YOLOv5: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
Used for object detection
Pytorch Installation
PyTorch Installation: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
## Libraries Used
! OpenCV – face and eye detection.
! TensorFlow –keras uses TensorFlow as backend.
Keras – to build our classification model.
Pygame – to play alarm sound
PyTorch - provides us with three object detection models: Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, Faster R-CNN with a MobileNet v3 backbone, RetinaNet with a ResNet50 backbone
